This a simple OO JS file to allow polling of YCombinator with YQL,
though it could be easily adapted to polling any YQL statement/
Google news page for links (I think it's the same XPath?).

Either way, I only wrote this README to make Github happy, so
read the code if you want to understand what it does or go to
